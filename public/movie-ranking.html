<h1> Karla's ultimate movie suggestion list</h1>
<h2> The best movie's according to Karla</h2>
<hr/>
<h3> Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind</h3>
<p>A great movie!</p>
<h3>The Green Book</h3>
<p> Watched it with Pikos on new year's eve, then the pandemic happened
    <br/> oh well!, probably unrelated
</p>
<h3>I cann't think of any other movies</h3>
<p> but some of my favourite TV series are:
    <ol>
        <li> Gilmore Girls        </li>
        <li>How I met your mother</li>
        <li>New Girl</li>
        <li>Superstore</li>
    </ol>
